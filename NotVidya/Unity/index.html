Unity3d Projects and stuff<br>
All of the will run in unity web player. Some also have a downloadable and executable version that runs on windows.<br>
These are just a bunch of random projects of mine.<br><br>

<font size=6 color=#0000FF>'BHOP Sim 2013'</font><br>
<a href="./bhopsim01.html">v1</a> 
<a href="./bhopsim02.html">v2</a> 
<a href="./bhopsim03.html">v3</a> 
<br>
Bunnyhopping Simulator 2013.<br>
Simulates the glitch in quake-based engines that allows players to accelerate in the air by turning, except with a lower skill floor.<br>
<br> <br> <br> 




<font size=6 color=#0000FF>'TapRPG'</font><br>
<a href="./tapRPGv0.4.1.html">v0.4.1</a> 
<a href="./tapRPGv0.4.2.html">v0.4.2</a> 
<a href="./tapRPGv0.4.3.html">v0.4.3</a>
<br>
<a href="./tapRPGv1.0.0.html">v1.0.0</a>
<br>
Grindy game based on 'Hentaiverse' (not what it sounds like).<br>
Kill monsters and upgrade yourself basically forever.<br>
Might be pretty addictive for those who like these kinds of games.<br>
<br> <br> <br> 


<font size=6 color=#0000FF>'ScrollanShootan'</font><br>
<a href="./scrollingShooter01.html">v1</a>
<br>
Small little top-down scrolling shootemup.<br>
Created all assets in this one myself.<br>
<br> <br> <br> 

<font size=6 color=#0000FF>'Infinigrinder'</font><br>
<a href="./infinigrinder01.html">v0.0.1</a>
<a href="./infinigrinder02.html">v0.0.2</a>
<a href="./infinigrinder03.html">v0.0.3</a>
<br>
<a href="./infinigrinder04.html">v0.1.6</a> 
<a href="./infinigrinder05.html">v0.1.8</a> 
<a href="./infinigrinder06.html">v0.1.9</a> 
<a href="./infinigrinder07.html">v0.1.10</a> 
<a href="./infinigrinder0.1.17.html">v0.1.17</a>
<br>
<a href="./infinigrinder08.html">v0.3.2</a>
<a href="./infinigrinder09.html">v0.3.4</a>
<a href="./infinigrinder10.html">v0.3.6</a>
<br>
This is a dungeon crawler I've been working on and off on for a while.
I have done quite a bit with it, but still want to add more content.
I plan to release this game on the android 'when it gets done'.
I want to create a full, grinding-centered experience. 
Generates worlds, items (equipment), and enemies.<br>
<br> <br> <br> 

<font size=6 color=#0000FF>'FlyanGaem'</font><br>
<a href="./flyangaem1.html">v1</a>
<a href="./flyangaem2.html">v2</a>
<a href="./flyangaem3.html">v3</a>
<a href="./flyangaem4.html">v4</a>
<a href="./flyangaem5.html">v5</a>
<a href="./flyangaem6.html">v6</a> <br>
<a href="./flyangaem7.html">r2v1</a>
<br>
This is one of my earlier Unity projects.<br>
I always wanted to make a game like Ace Online, and so when I started using Unity, I decided to try to duplicate the flying mechanics in Ace Online.
I think it turned out pretty well, but I really want to refine it further and make a game that goes in a different direction than Ace does.
Perferably something that isn't pay to win.
<br> <br> <br>


<font size=6 color=#0000FF>'Space Thing'</font><br>
<a href="./space.html">v1</a> 
<br>
Small little space game prototype. Doesn't have much there, just a proof of concept.
<br> <br> <br> 

<font size=6 color=#0000FF>'Animes'</font><br>
<a href="./Animes.html">v1</a> <br>
No Comment<br>
<br> <br> <br>


<font size=6 color=#0000FF>'The Staircase'</font><br>
<a href="./thestaircase.html">v1</a>
<a href="./thestaircase02.html">v2</a>
<br>
Jumping on the SCP-087 Staircase bandwagon.<br>
<br> <br> <br>




<font size=6 color=#0000FF>'Tiles'</font><br>
<a href="./tiles01.html">v1</a>
<a href="./tiles02.html">v2</a>
<a href="./tiles03.html">v3</a>
<br>
2D Tile-based game in Unity.<br>
A simple game I made that uses an Orthographic mode camera to render a scene 'pixel-perfect' to the screen.
Uses a sprite animator and an adapted version of the 2dplatform movement.
I do a little bit of procedural generation to randomize the look of the world.
I am currently working on optimizing the rendering of worlds, right now each 'tile' is its own object with its own collider and renderer.
This is incredibly inefficient. I want to make each room (loaded from a file) 
create its own colliders, and one renderer, in the most efficient way possible on load.<br>
<br> <br> <br>




<font size=6 color=#0000FF>'ShootanGaem'</font><br>
<a href="./shootanGaem.html">v1</a>
<br>
A simple FPS. I started playing around with Unity and ended up making this.
Not really working on this one any more.<br>
<br> <br> <br>




<font size=6 color=#0000FF>'2dPlatform'</font><br>
<a href="./2dplatform.html">v1</a>
<a href="./2dplatformv2.html">v2</a>
<a href="./2dplatformv3.html">v3</a>
<a href="./2dplatformv4.html">v4</a>
<a href="./2dplatformv5.html">v5</a>
<a href="./2dplatformv6.html">v6</a>
<a href="./2dplatformv7.html">v7</a>
<br>
These were made for a capstone project.
I didnt do the art, but did most of the coding and importing/animating.
Wish I could have done more with this. Didn't have as much time as I would have liked to work on it.<br>
<br> <br> <br>




<!--
There's a lot of half-assed games out there that use grinding to cheaply get people to play.
With this game, I am trying to take elements from other games that I have played, 
and combine only the ones that complement each other in the sense of a good game that people feel like they can always go back to.
Of course, the game is still in infancy right now. I hope that this game will actually go somewhere.
<br> <br>
Currently, the item generator:<br>
-Generates generic 'loot' items <br>
-Weapons (melee, bow, wand) with their own attacking styles<br>
-Armor (helm, body, hand, foot, leg), each with their own equipment slot<br>
-Accessories (rings, necklaces, bracelets) to equipped in one of many 'accessory' slots<br>
<br>
Item Gen TBD:<br>
-Medicine items that heal HP/MP. Each generated with its own amount of healing power.<br>
-Buff items that can increase a number of 'Base Stats' and 'Combat Stats'<br>
-Make item values not scale so damn high<br>
<br>
Other TBD Stuff:<br>
-Elemental weapons with their own attack effects (Fire Sword shooting a fireball with each swing, fire bow shooting an explosive arrow, etc)<br>
-More enemy types<br>
-Better elite mob system<br>
-Bosses<br>
-SOME Unique items that can only be obtained from bosses, and have NO random qualities<br>
(Unique items should be just that - unique)<br>
-World-Seed keyword system like the .hack games, and bosses that only appear in certain worlds.<br>
-Dungeons, generated in a different way than the fields.<br>
