TAPRPG V0.4.2<br>
<a href="http://notvidya.zxq.net/TapRPG/begin.html">THERES TOO MANY THINGS, I NEED HELPS (aka click me for the help page)</a>
<br>
Some changes since last version:<br>
Tweaked some icons to make them look more interesting.<br>
Weapon/Armor skill is now capped based on your level.<br>
EXP to Level now follows a slightly different curve, making lower levels a little faster, but slowing down a bunch for later levels.<br>
Skills have been nerfed, multitarget skills more than single target skills.<br>
Difficulties have been tweaked, slightly.<br>
Enemies drop less GP on average, making the arena clear bonus worthwhile again.<br>
They still can drop a ton, if you are lucky, but it won't happen as often.<br>
<br>
Stupid grindy game that I've been working on for Android/iOS.<br>
Has cloud saving and whatnot- you can login to upload/download saves to a server.<br>
You constantly gain power as you gain exp and golds/gems to upgrade yourself.<br>
Difficulty modes make it even more grindy- fight stronger monsters for better rewards!<br>
Icon graphics based off of icons from E-Hentai.org's Hentaiverse, which I have been addicted to for the past few months.<br>
In combat, you can also use #1-5 to use normal attacks on enemies<br>
