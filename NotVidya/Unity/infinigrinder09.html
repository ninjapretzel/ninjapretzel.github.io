<br>
Use WASD or Arrows to move. Click to fire towards the mouse<br>
With a controller, move with the left stick and attack with the right (like geometry wars)<br>
Kill enemies, they will drop stuff.<br>
You can't die yet. I figure its more of a pain when you die in a demo so thats off till later<br>
You can equip weapons and armor that you find.<br>
There's already quite a number of possibilities for weapons and armor to be generated.<br>
<br>Changes since last version:<br>
New enemy models<br>
Slight balance changes per stat (affects both players and enemies)<br>
Minimap, both on field and inside dungeons.<br>
Shouldn't ever fall through floors when spawning on the field anymore.<br>
Generic prefix bonuses can be applied up to 5 times/3 times for primary/secondary generic prefixes<br>
Some new textures in some areas - can't be arsed to list them all here.<br>
Portals are larger.<br>
<br>

Please send feedback to ninjapretzel@yahoo.com<br>
Let me know how the game runs and what specs you have<br>
I'm trying to build this game so it will run on most computers and Android phones.<br>
Will be adding more stuff with each revision<br>
<br>
V0.3.2<br>
Lots of changes from previous version.
SAVING AND LOADING HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED. However- Unity won't let webplayer load data saved by a different URL- so any saves from the web version are locked to that URL.<br>
This means as I upload new versions, you will have to start over each time on the web.<br>
Standalone saves and loads from the registry, so saves will be able to be loaded between versions.<br>
Added a keyword system to generate areas. Right now its an obvious ripoff of .hack//'s awesome keyword system, but it will be refined into something more unique eventually<br>
Added a 'field' level. This is the 'top level' in an area, and is where you warp to when you enter an area. These are really tiny right now, but will be expanded to be larger<br>
The field areas 'wrap around' - if you keep walking in one direction, you end up back where you started.<br>
Enemies don't spawn infinitly on the field - yet. There are still enemy spawners in the dungeon.<br>
Drop rate is reduced a ton to make items actually valuable.<br>
<br>
Please leave feedback!<br>
