Welcome to TapRPG, and endless CPG (Character Progression Game) that you can bring with you wherever you go on a mobile Android device.<br>
<br>
This is a game to play whenever you need to wait on something that takes a really long time, or are otherwise just bored.<br>
Or if you don't have internet to access one of the many timesink games that can only be played with an internet connection.<br>
<br>
This is my favorite type of game, a grindy game that has no end, that can just be played on and on and on and on and on. You get the idea<br>
<br>
I built this game after being addicted to a similar game, Hentaiverse. Yeah. I know what it sounds like. Its not that.<br>
I still play that game from time to time. It's only fair that I link to it: <a href="http://hentaiverse.org">http://hentaiverse.org</a><br>

For general help, I wrote a quick <a href="begin.html"><b>Guide</b></a> that explains the game.<br>
If you read the guide, and still need a bit of guidance, here is a short <a href="help.html"><b>Walkthrough</b></a> that explains how to spend your stats.<br>
