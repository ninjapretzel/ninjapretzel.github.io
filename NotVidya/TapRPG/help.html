<font size=6><b>How Do I start?</b></font><br>
So you read the guide, and still need a little direction? No problem.<br>
Here's some suggestions on how to spend your stat points.<br>
<br>
<font size=6><b>1. Skills/Stats</b></font><br>
First, aquire some skills. Skills will let you kill enemies faster, and even hit multiple enemies at the same time.<br>
The first three skills are cheap, unlockable with 1 SP each.<br>
<br>

Smash has a decent damage bonus, and has a short cooldown, allowing you to use it repeatedly to keep damage coming out at an enemy.<br>
Break is the first multitarget skill you get. It doesn't do much damage, but basically lets you hit multiple monsters with normal attack damage.<br>
Slice has a higher damage bonus than Smash, but a longer cooldown. It is still useful for laying down a bit of hurt every few rounds.<br>
<br>
After you have these skills, you can decide if you want to wait until later to purchase more skills.<br>
They become a bit more expensive to unlock- up to 100 SP for the first level of Ender, but they do make clearing rounds much easier!<br>
<br>
I would suggest saving to purchase at least Cleave and Ragnarok, giving you an additional single-target and multi-target attack, then purchasing Reform, a healing skill.<br>
After a while, you will have enough money to purchase all the skills, and level them up a few times.<br>
This makes them really quite powerful, and it's very difficult to accomplish anything with just the auto-attack.<br>

If you are just looking to up your clear speed, it is a good idea to invest some points into STR (Strength), DEX (Dexterity), and Cruelty.<br>
Upping your clear speed will let you clear rounds faster, making the EXP and GP come faster.<br>
<br>
Haste is also a useful skill to invest into. With Haste Lv 10, combat will move at twice the speed, and you can continue upgrading it (if you have the sp to spare!)<br>
Also useful are Greed and Adept, which will give you a percentage bonus on earned EXP and GP.<br>
This is key to earning more EXP and GP!<br>
Of course, investing everything into those skills will make you a bit weaker than otherwise, but having a bonus for a small investment is a good tradeoff<br>
<br>
Remember, all that damage for clear speed will only get you so far. In order to last really long, you will need defense as well!<br>
<br>
<font size=6><b>2. Gear</b></font><br>
Upgrading your gear will greatly increase your power. <br>
You don't start out with any money, but doing Instant Action will allow you to easily earn a little bit of gold here and there.<br>
You should easily be able to earn enough GP to upgrade all your gear by one level, as the first level only costs 100GP.<br>
The next level costs 1000, then 2000, then 3100, and so on.<br>
Your weapon, armor, and pendant should be your first priorities.<br>
Later on, a high level flask will let you recover all of your health with one potion!<br>
It will take you a while, but everything is attainable in this game, even though it takes a while to get there.<br>
<br>
<br>

<font size=6><b>3. Fight! And keep fighting!</b></font><br>
Really. This game is a grind. <b>It's something to pass time with.</b><br>
On a long trip? Perfect. At lunch at school? Cool.<br>
Try to clear as many arenas as you can, or try to go as long in instant action as you can.<br>
If you can drive yourself to do it, perfect! Do it!<br>
This is the kind of game that I love playing, ones that dump you into a world for you to figure out.<br>
I hope this is enough help for anyone to figure out my game, so happy grinding!<br>
