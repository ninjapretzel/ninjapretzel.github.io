				<h1>Procedural Generation</h1>
				<h3>Projecting procedural textures onto 3d surfaces</h3>
			</div>
			
			<div class="col s12">
				<h5>Background </h5>
				<p>
					A little bit of background before we dive right into projecting our textures onto 3d objects:
				</p>
				<p>
					So far, we have only been working with one kind of shader program: Fragment shaders.
					A full shader program is comprised of both a Vertex and a Fragment shader.
					I can't do a good job explaining how these two things work in tandem, thankfully, there's
					a few animations that do it much better than I could explain
					<a href="http://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-how-it-works.html">Here</a>.
					
					The two animations to look at are the one near the top, just under the first block of code,
					and another one further down, with a triangle with very jagged, pixelated edges.
				</p>
				<p>
					The primary differences between the 'vertex' and 'fragment' shaders are:
					<ol>
						<li>The vertex shader processes verticies</li>
						<li>The fragment shader processes pixels</li>
						<li>The fragment shader (typically) runs more times, and does more work</li>
					</ol>
					In the last 'paper', most of the examples were simply fragment shaders,
					running for every pixel in a canvas object. Behind that, there was a vertex shader,
					which didn't do much, just to make the entire canvas be used.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In this 'paper', we are moving on to write shaders for the Unity3d game engine.
					Shaders for this platform are a bit different, and come in many varieties.
					One method of producing shaders allows for controlling the legacy 'Fixed Function' pipeline.
					This is a bit less useful for us, since we want to be able to write more complex programs,
					rather than just telling the graphics card how to sample and blend texture images.
					We will be focusing on using Surface Shaders. This kind of shader works a bit differently
					than what we have been doing so far.
				</p>
					
				<p>
					Unity's surface shader expects more than just a single color as output, instead, it
					expects a much larger struct, containing more information about the pixel.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="card blue-grey lighten-4 col s8 offset-s2">
				<div class="chip">Given by Unity's built-in documentation:</p></div>
				<pre>
    fixed3 Albedo;      // base (diffuse or specular) color
    fixed3 Specular;    // specular color
    fixed3 Normal;      // tangent space normal, if written
    half3 Emission
    half Metallic;      // 0=non-metal, 1=metal
    half Smoothness;    // 0=rough, 1=smooth
    half Occlusion;     // occlusion (default 1)
    fixed Alpha;        // alpha for transparencies
</pre>
				
			</div>
			
			<div class="col s12">
				<p>
					They also provide a version that takes also has a 'fixed3 Specular' property for specular highlight color.
					This struct is then used by a lighting function to produce the actual color of the pixel.
				</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Albedo is the primary output for surfaces, which is what recieves the light.</li>
						<li>Specular controls the color of specular reflections. 
								By default, this is just white (100% of whatever light is being reflected)</li>
						<li>The Emission property is light that is always present (Emitted by the surface), and used for glows.</li>
						<li>Metallic and Smoothness properties determine the general reflectiveness of the surface,
								both to light sources and to the ambient environment reflections.</li>
						<li>Occulsion determines how exposed that part of the surface is to light.
								This adds to the appearance of depth on the surface.</li>
						<li>Alpha has no use for opaque surfaces, but can be used to either fade transparent surfaces,
								Or 'clip' pixels off of partial surfaces, like leaves.</li>
					</ol>
					
				<p>
					Our 'surface' shader writes to these properties of a struct, 
					and then that struct is unpacked and processed by a lighting function.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Unity's shader system is pretty extensible, and even allows for custom user lighting functions.
					The lighting function is what actually does what our fragment shaders were doing previously 
					(determining a single color).
				</p>
				<p>
					However, the presence of other properties gives us other places where we can provide details
					to make the surfaces have more detail.
				</p>
				<p>	
					For example, besides the Albedo property,
					we could vary the Metallic and Smoothness properties based on our noise functions,
					as well the Occulsion, Normal, and Emissive properties.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unity's pipeline also does a lot of other useful stuff, like providing different information
					into the fragment/surface shaders, through a user-defined struct (Input) which can
					hold whatever information is needed, as well as allowing users to provide information themselves
					through custom vertex functions, as well as automatically compiling a number of different variants
					of the surface shader for different 'passes', and in different rendering modes.
					It also creates a way to pipe information about the shader for each 'material' that uses that shader program.
				</p>
				<p>
					We use this system to grab the worldspace coordinates of the pixel that is being rendered, (The 'worldPos' field in the 'Input' struct)
					and we use that information to sample the noise fields to build the texture. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, Unity has retired their Web Player plugin, and doesn't properly support
					complex shaders in their WebGL pipeline, yet.
					So, there's no graceful way to embed these examples into the pages this time.
					Instead, there will be embedded images or videos.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, much of the stuff that has been done, has been ported to Nvidia Cg, (C for Graphics).
					Most of the common functions have been separated into cginclude files, similar to headers.

					Wow, that was a huge amount of stuff. It starts with the properties block. This defines what data is piped into the shader
					from the engine, allowing people other than the programmer to define things about the shader. Each of the lines in this section
					corrospond to a variable defined below (the variables starting with _). 
					Then there's a bunch of #include directives pointing to some of the cginc files listed above, and some other compile directive stuff.
					
					Below, towards the bottom, the last few lines assign to the surface outputs.
					The middle part is still relatively the same.

						This is one of the simpler effects. Again, I didn't come up with this myself, but have seen it used in numerous places.
						The meat of the effect is the calculation of the value:
					</p>
					<p><tt>float v = ( 1 + sin( ( pos.x + nnoise(pos, _Factor) ) * 50 ) ) / 2;</tt></p>
					<p>
						Which is used to lerp between two colors.
						
						The inputs to the sin function are the x position (which always increases)
						and the noise value at the point (which is essentially random).
						This creates a sort of 'grain' in the surface.
						This effect might be good for creating a bit of regularity in a surface, such as the grain of wood, or layers in sandstone.

						On octaves deeper than the first, there's an additional sample of the noise function used to animate the electrons.
						This extra field is panned across the first field, which is what makes the electrons move.
						Only a small section of the field is animated this way (sample value between certain values), so the electrons
						are confined to the 'wires' instead of the 'cells'.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is the last effect I used someone else's work on.
						The original effect I based this on can be found <a href="http://glslsandbox.com/e#35914.0">Here</a>.
						This is one of the effects that I got inspired by, and got me writing these effects in the first place,
						and even after all this time (and especially that I now undestand exactly how it works), I still find it a really cool effect.

						This effect turned out way better than I expected.
						I used a technique for parallax, where the height of the surface is controlled by a Voroni Cellular noise.
						The parallax calculation is fairly simple for the visual interest it adds. It's included in the 'procheight.cginc' file:

					<pre>inline float3 parallax3d(Input IN, float3 h) {
    const float3 nrm = normalize(IN.wNormal);
    const float hv = h * _Parallax - _Parallax * _Bias;
    const float3 eye = normalize(IN.viewDir);
    float3 dir = eye - nrm * dot(eye, nrm) / dot(nrm, nrm);
    return hv * -dir;
}</pre>

					<p>
						That is used to offset the sample for the actual texture.
						The eye direction (<tt>dir</tt>) on the last line can be flipped to taste, neither looks perfect, as this technique works 
						much more simply in on 2 dimensional textures, and not that well on 3 dimensional textures.
						Parallax calculations in 2d and 3d both rely on projecting the eye vector onto the surface 
						and offseting the texture sample in that direction by some distance, based on the height sample.
					</p>
						
					<p>
						Then, the noise field is re-sampled at the offset position.
						Then, the result is used to calculate albedo, normals, and is also applied to the 'Glossiness' and 'Metallic'ness of the pixel.
						I added another feature (_Polish) which changes how much 'Glossiness' and 'Metallic'ness the pixel has based on the 'height' of the pixel.
					</p>
					<p>
						Not being content, I took a technique from the previous 'Digital Brain' effect, and added another set of samples
						to the voroni noise function, this time, 3 of them, at different frequencies. Then blended an amount of the resulting samples
						to the output, and panned those extra samples across the surface, creating an animated, liquid covered texture.
					</p>
					<p>
						I then modified this water texture to be like a slime covered rock, panning at a slower speed,
						with lower amounts of higher frequency noise blended.

						The original effect sampled the noise function a few times, for 'height' and 'moisture' values, then, like the camo effect,
						'Clips' the texture into different regions, but instead, based on the combination of the values.

						This adaptation works much the same way, but with improved surfaces, and adjustments to 'height'/'moisture'

						This one was very interesting to write, and looks very convincing until you get right up close to it.
						It's a simple Euclidean-distance voroni noise, filtered and processed in such a way that not all holes pass.
						Then, the edges of the holes are adjusted they are smooth, rounded craters, with a slight lip around the edge.
						And, of course, the craters are fractalized, and it uses the same height-parallax technique the 'Lumpy' shader does.
