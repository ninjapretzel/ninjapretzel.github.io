					<h5>Building textures</h5>
					Lets look at the process of building these camo textures, and some other textures.
					The first thing we do, is build 'difference noise'
					I based the shader off of a tutorial found at
					<a href="http://www.quantumpetshop.com/tutorials/camo.asp">Quantum Pet Shop</a>.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					This is a noise variation that is built from taking the differences between multiple samples of noise.
					The output value is 0 when the noises are the same, and 1 when the noises are maximally different (0 and 1 or 1 and 0).
					This creates an interesting pattern with 'ribbon' like features stretching across the noise field.
				</p>

					<canvas id="dNoiseEx" width="600" height="200"></canvas>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="col s12">
				<p>
					We can do this a number of times, and compile a bunch of difference noise ontop of itself.

				</div>
				
			</div>
			
			<div class="col s12">
				<p>
					The next step was is to increase the contrast of difference noise, so that there's only black and white output.
					This creates two separate regions. One of these regions can be used, and the other can be discarded.
					Then we do this 3 times, and assign each one a different color.

			<div class="col s12">

					Then, we just composite all of these on top of eachother, and assign a 'background' color.

				<p>
					And then, we can change parameters for colors, seed, scale, etc, to generate different textures.
					View a few example variants <a href="02_camos.html">Here</a>.
					The code is included in the source for each page, and this <a href="common.js">common.js</a> file included in each page.

					I also converted this other tutorial on creating
					<a href="http://www.quantumpetshop.com/tutorials/elecrings.asp">Electric arcs</a>.
					I had to do some research on how the 'curves' and 'levels' filters work in Photoshop.

					I do a few extra things as well, like rotating the ring over time,
					and offsetting the time of the animation by the distance from the center.

					<h5>Cellular Noise</h5>
					Sometimes, we need a different kind of noise, to generate other interesting looking things.
					We can build a 3d 'voroni distance' noise out of our noise function.

				These are referred to as 'cellular noise', and are a very useful noise 'primitive'.
				These noises are based off of the distance from the point a pixel is at, to the closest 'feature'.
				To get these feature points, we sample a hash function at some offset from the original pixel,
				and use the resulting value from the hash function to offset the position of the 'feature' point from the
				fixed grid we're sampling on.
